# Red-Wine-Quality
This project explores a classic regression and classification case study in data science using the Red Wine Quality dataset, widely recognized for teaching fundamental concepts in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. The dataset contains physicochemical measurements of red wine samples, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide levels, alcohol content, and more — totaling 1,599 records across 12 features, including the target variable: wine quality (score 0–10).

Using Python and core data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, this project showcases a complete end-to-end workflow: from cleaning missing and duplicate values, generating descriptive statistics, visualizing feature distributions and correlations, to building classification models that predict wine quality based on chemical properties.

The structured nature of this dataset and its real-world relevance make it a strong foundation for understanding how chemical compositions impact wine quality. Through this analysis, learners gain intuition around data preparation, feature importance, and interpreting model outputs — making it an excellent starting point for beginners in data science and machine learning focused on food science, sustainability, or quality control.
